  // Works exactly same as the blocking_mpmc_unbounded queue (see this once)
  // with tail pointer pointing to stub node and your head pointer updates as
  // per the pushes. See the Lockless_Node in utils to understand the working.
  // Note that the next pointers are atomic there. Why ?? [Reason this]
  // Also the head and tail members are cache-aligned. Why ?? [Reason this] (ask
  // me for details)

  // [Copy of blocking_mpmc_unbounded]
  // For the implementation, we start with a stub node and both head and tail
  // are initialized to it. When we push, we make a new stub node, move the data
  // into the current tail and then change the tail to the new stub. We have two
  // methods : wait_and_pop() which waits on the queue and returns element &
  // try_pop() which returns an element if queue is not empty otherwise returns
  // some neutral element OR a false boolean whichever is applicable. Pop works
  // by returning the data stored in head node and replacing head to its next
  // node. We handle the empty queue gracefully as per the pop type.

  std::atomic<node*> tail; //tail is required to be atomic as producer changes the tail while pushing
                          // and consumer may try to read the tail while checking if the queue is empty.
                          // If tail was not atomic this might lead to data race, that is while a consumer tries
                          // to read it; the tail might get updated by the producer but the consumer gets the old value.
